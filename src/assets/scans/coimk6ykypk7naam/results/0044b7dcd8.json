Vernon where he spent most of time tending the field. His health started deteriorating terribly in mid-1799, and he kicked the bucket at his home on the 14th of December, 1799. It is believed that he died of acute case of laryngitis and pneumonia. A few people know about the details of his death, which is non-essential because what really matters most are his various achievements and contributions as a leader\nWashington was one of the men who said the country needed a new constitution. The delegates wrote the Constitution of the United States, and all the states ratified it and joined the new government.\nGeorge Washingtons presidency was marked by a series of firsts. He signed the first United States copyright law, protecting the copyrights of authors.\nHowever, the general public did not always remember the Virginia-born Washington kindly after the War of Secession. Northerners in general preferred to remember Northern Founding Fathers such as John Adams, Alexander Hamilton and Benjamin Franklin. Nonetheless, the U.S. rebuilt the Washington Monument after it was destroyed during the Great War.\nWashington returned to Mount Vernon and devoted his attentions to making the plantation as productive as it had been before he became president. More than four decades of public service had aged him, but he was still a commanding figure. In December 1799, he caught a cold after inspecting his properties in the rain. The cold developed into a throat infection and Washington died on the night of December 14, 1799 at the age of 67. He was entombed at Mount Vernon, which in 1960 was designated a national historic landmark\nGrowing partisanship within the government also concerned Washington. Many men in the new government -- including Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and other leaders of the emerging Republican party -- were opposed to Hamiltons financial program.\nGrowing up, George Washingtons family owned a lot of property, but they were still not considered rich in 18th-century society\nBefore 1920, the Confederate States esteemed Washington as a Founding Father as well, but generally preferred their own founding fathers such as John C. Calhoun, Jefferson Davis, and Robert E. In 1914, President Woodrow Wilson invoked George Washington in his speech asking for Congress for a declaration of war against the USA while speaking in Richmond.\nAt first Washington balked. He wanted to, at last, return to a quiet life at home and leave governing the new nation to others. But public opinion was so strong that eventually he gave in. The first presidential election was held on January 7, 1789, and Washington won handily. John Adams (1735-1826), who received the second-largest number of votes, became the nations first vice president. The 57-year-old Washington was inaugurated on April 30, 1789, in New York City. Because Washington, D.C., Americas future capital city wasnt yet built, he lived in New York and Philadelphia.

He then oversaw the creation of a strong, well-financed national government, suppressed the Whiskey Rebellion, and popularized the new Federal government. Washington was impartial with the rival parties founded by two of his cabinet secretaries: Thomas Jeffersons Democratic-Republican Party and Alexander Hamiltons Federalist Party. However he did adopt Hamiltons programs to satisfy federal and state debts, establish a permanent seat of government, implement an effective tax system, and create a national bank. When the French Revolution plunged Europe into war, Washington initially assumed a policy of neutrality, to protect American shipping abroadthough the Jay Treaty of 1795 created an alliance with Great Britain.

He ran as a nonpartisan candidate in the presidential elections of 1789 and 1792. To this day, Washington is the only U.S.\nDefending New York was almost impossible. Howes army was larger, better equipped, and far better trained than Washingtons. They defeated Washingtons army at Long Islandin August and routed the Americans a few weeks later at Kips Bay, resulting in the loss of the city. Forced to retreat northward, Washington was defeated again at White Plains. The American defense of New York City came to a humiliating conclusion on November 16, 1776, with the surrender of Fort Washington and some 2,800 men. Washington ordered his army to retreat across New Jersey. The remains of his forces, mud-soaked and exhausted, crossed the Delaware River into Pennsylvania on December 7.\nIn 1734, Augustine moved the family up the Potomac River to another Washington home, Little Hunting Creek Plantation (later renamed Mount Vernon).

The son of a prosperous planter, Washington was raised in colonial Virginia. As a young man, he worked as a surveyor then fought in the French and Indian War (1754-63). During the American Revolution, he led the colonial forces to victory over the British and became a national hero. In 1787, he was elected president of the convention that wrote the U.S. Constitution. Two years later, Washington became Americas first president.

Mindful that his actions would likely determine how future presidents were expected to govern, Washington worked hard to set an example of fairness, prudence and integrity. In foreign matters, he supported cordial relations with other countries but also favored a position of neutrality in foreign conflicts. Domestically, he nominated the first chief justice of the U. Supreme Court, John Jay (1745-1829), signed a bill establishing the first national bank, the Bank of the United States, and set up his own presidential cabinet.\nDec 29, 2015  ISBN 9780448483122  Middle Grade (8-12) Buy This format is not eligible to earn points towards the Reader Rewards program\nIn 1789, Washington was elected president without any competition, making him the first President of the United States.

Roosevelt in 1940\n\n\n\n\n\nGeorge Washington - Harry Turtledove Wiki - Historical fiction, Days of Infamy, Homeward Bound\nAnother way that George Washington was able to show admirable perseverance was through the important role in achieving national independence. He had to join in battle, fight in the revolutionary war, negotiate with opposing countries, and create a strong government. Creating a new government needs perseverance because nothing goes perfectly and as such, changes have to be made. He declined the tempting offer to be the king was offered to be king, but he denied because he wanted the United States to be a democracy with voting.\nWashington was a delegate to the First Continental Congress, which was created by the Thirteen Colonies to respond to various laws passed by the British government. The Second Continental Congress chose him to be the commanding general of the Continental Army. After losing the big Battle of Long Island, and being chased across New Jersey, Washington led his troops back across the Delaware River on Christmas Day, 1776, in a surprise attack on Hessian mercenaries at the small Battle of Princeton and Trenton, New Jersey. The British had more troops and more supplies than Washington, however, Washington kept his troops together and won these small battles.\nOn January 6th, 1759, Washington married Martha Dandridge Custis, a charming and vivacious young woman from the Tidewater area of Virginia. Martha brought enormous wealth, along with two small children, Jacky and Patsy, to the marriage. It was her second marriage, his first.About two weeks after the battle at Yorktown, Washingtons stepson, John Parke Custis(Jacky), died of camp fever at the age of 27. Ironically, the spoiled and indolent young man had not fought in the war but had, at its end, traveled to Yorktown to serve as a civilian aide to his stepfather. He was the last of Marthas remaining children. His sister Patsyhad died as a teenager eight years earlier following an epileptic seizure.Martha Washington joined her husband in his winter quarters every year of the war. Together they entertained his officers and guests. A patriot in her own right, Mrs. Washington made it her war too, nursing sick and wounded soldiers and raising money for the troops. Needlework helped her to pass the time through the long, cold winters. In all, she would spend about half the war in camp.Two of Martha Washingtons grandchildren, Eleanor (Nelly) Parke Custis(b. 1779) and George Washington (Washy) Parke Custis(b. 1781) came to live with their grandparents after their father died following the Battle of Yorktown. Washington loved his step-grandchildren as his very own.\nWashington was one of the men who said the country needed a new constitution. The delegates wrote the Constitution of the United States, and all the states ratified it and joined the new government.\nIt is a common misconception that George Washington had wooden teeth, as false teeth.[9] He did, however, try many different ways to replace his teeth, including having teeth carved from elks teeth or ivory.[10][11]Ivory and bone both have hairline fractures in them, which normally cannot be seen, but started to darken due to Washingtons use of wine. The darkened, thin fractures in the bone made the lines look like the grain in a piece of wood.[12] George Washingtons teeth started falling out when he was about 22 years old, and he had only one tooth left by the time he became president. At one time, he had false teeth with a special hole so the one tooth he still had could poke through.[10][11] He tried to keep them smelling clean by soaking them in wine, but instead they became mushy and black.[10][11] In 1796, a dentist had to pull out George Washingtons last tooth, and he kept his tooth in a gold locket attached to his watch chain.[10] When the time came for the president to have his portrait painted, cotton was pushed under his lips to make him look as if he had teeth.[10][11] The cotton made his mouth puff out, as is seen on the picture on the US 1 bill.[11]\nWashington emerged as the top leader when the time came for voters to select their first leader in 1789.S. was unanimous. His second term in 1792 was also voted unanimously by the American people who believed in his leadership. Even though he accomplished a lot during his eight-year presidency, the Bill of Rights which was adopted in 1791 is considered as his most paramount accomplishment was that of the Bill of Rights. Peoples admiration only got stronger when he refused to serve a third term. In his farewell speech, he explained that serving in a third term can only give one leader too much power.\nFrom his marriage, George Washington owned a substantial amount of farm land, where he grew tobacco, wheat, and vegetables. Washington also owned more than 100 slaves, who were freed upon his death. He did not have much money in cash and had to borrow money while he was president.\nIn short, yes. Washington was born into a Virginia planter family. After his fathers death in 1743, Washington inherited 10 slaves. In 1761 Washington acquired a farmhouse (which he later expanded to a five-farm estate) called Mount Vernon. In 1760, 49 slaves lived and worked on the estate; by 1799 that number had increased to over 300.

He was unanimously chosen to preside over theConstitutional Convention, a job that took four months. He spoke very little in the convention, but few delegates were more determined to devise a government endowed with real energy and authority. My wish, he wrote, is that the convention may adopt no temporizing expedients but probe the defects of the Constitution to the bottom and provide a radical cure\nOne of George Washingtons greatest qualities as a leader was perseverance. He pursued his various endeavours in life with perseverance, beginning with self-education after he was prohibited from attending school.

A determined person would hardly get frustrated even if he lacked the knowledge to do his task or he couldnt figure something out.\nThe story that Washington threw a silver dollar across the Potomac River -- an impossible feat -- had its origins in the recollections of a cousin that George could throw a stone across the much narrower Rappahannock River\nOn December 23, 1783, Washington presented himself before Congress in Annapolis, Maryland, and resigned his commission.

Washington University in Lexington, Virginia, home of the Confederacys effort to build a superbomb, retained its name, and the statue of Washington that stood in Richmond survived both Great Wars.\nEven as President, Washingtons thoughts often turned to Mount Vernon. As horses circled the second floor, they treaded on the wheat that had been spread there, breaking the grain from the chaff. The wheat would fall through gaps in the floorboards to the first floor, where it was winnowed. After winnowing, the grain was taken to the gristmill and ground into flour. From the Presidents House in Philadelphia, Washington followed the barns construction every step of the way. He even correctly calculated the number of bricks needed for the first floor  which turned out to be exactly 30,820\nMount Vernon is owned and maintained in trust for the people of the United States by the Mount Vernon Ladies Association of the Union, a private, non-profit organization.

In an attempt to take Trenton from the British, Washington and his men crossed the Delaware River on Christmas night of 1776.

Washington assumed the Presidency on the eve of the French Revolution, a time of great international crisis. The outbreak of a general European war in 1793 forced the crisis to the center of American politics. Washington believed the national interest of the United States dictated neutrality. The countrys future depended on the increase in wealth and opportunity that would come from commerce and westward expansion. One of Washingtons most important accomplishments was keeping the United States out of the war, giving the new nation an opportunity to grow in strength while establishing the principle of neutrality that shaped American foreign policy for more than a century. Although Washingtons department heads agreed that the United States should remain neutral, disagreements over foreign policy aggravated partisan tensions among them. The disagreements were part of the deepening division between Federalists and Republicans. Opposition to federal policies developed into resistance to the law in 1794as distillers in Western Pennsylvania rioted and refused to pay taxes.

Shortly after their arrival, George contracted smallpox. He survived, although the illness left him with permanent facial scars. Washington eventually inherited Lawrences estate, Mount Vernon, on the Potomac River near Alexandria, Virginia.\nGeorge Washington basically challenged himself to read books and use common sense to understand what the book was saying. You can imagine how he would have to read everything over and over to fully understand the thought or idea written on the book he was reading. If for instance he was trying to solve a mathematical problem and didnt know the correct answer, he would resort to asking the people in his household, but if they didnt have the correct answer themselves, George would need to try harder and persevere so he could learn.\nOver the years, Washington enlarged his house. First he raised the roof to create a third floor. Later he would add a wing to both ends, build a piazza overlooking the Potomac River, and crown his vision with a pediment and cupola. By the time of his death in 1799, he had expanded the plantation from 2,000 to 8,000 acres consisting of five farms, with more than 3,000 acres under cultivation. One pair of stones ground corn into meal for use at Mount Vernon and the other ground wheat into superfine flour for export to foreign ports. Washington also began making whiskey on the advice of his farm manager, James Anderson, a trained distiller from Scotland. He soon built one of the largest distilleries in America. At its peak, Washingtons distillery produced over 11,000 gallons of rye whiskey, becoming one of his most successful enterprises.\nPopular fables illustrating young George Washingtons youthful honesty, piety, and physical strength have long taken the place of documented fact.

His education included surveying which launched his early career as a surveyor. The Second Continental Congress made him commander-in-chief of the Continental Army in 1775. Washingtons strategy, field command, and development of the army, combined with an alliance with France, were crucial in defeating the British, who surrendered after the Siege of Yorktown. In 1783, the victorious Washington declined further power and resigned as commander-in-chief, affirming his devotion to American Republicanism. He was unanimously chosen to lead the Constitutional Convention in 1787 which devised the new Federal government.\nOnce the Constitution was approved, Washington hoped to retire again to private life. But when the first presidential election was held, he received a vote from every elector.\nGeorges father, Augustine Washington, was a leading planter in the area and also served as a justice of the county court.\nGeorge Washington (February 22, 1732[3][4][5]  December 14, 1799) was the first President of the United States (17891797), the commander in chief of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War,[6] and one of the Founding Fathers of the United States.\nGeorge Washington was born on 22nd February 1732 and grew up in colonial Virginia.

The cold developed into a throat infection and Washington died on the night of December 14, 1799 at the age of 67. He was entombed at Mount Vernon, which in 1960 was designated a national historic landmark\nGrowing partisanship within the government also concerned Washington.

He then oversaw the creation of a strong, well-financed national government, suppressed the Whiskey Rebellion, and popularized the new Federal government. Washington was impartial with the rival parties founded by two of his cabinet secretaries: Thomas Jeffersons Democratic-Republican Party and Alexander Hamiltons Federalist Party. However he did adopt Hamiltons programs to satisfy federal and state debts, establish a permanent seat of government, implement an effective tax system, and create a national bank. When the French Revolution plunged Europe into war, Washington initially assumed a policy of neutrality, to protect American shipping abroadthough the Jay Treaty of 1795 created an alliance with Great Britain.

Howes army was larger, better equipped, and far better trained than Washingtons. They defeated Washingtons army at Long Islandin August and routed the Americans a few weeks later at Kips Bay, resulting in the loss of the city. Forced to retreat northward, Washington was defeated again at White Plains. The American defense of New York City came to a humiliating conclusion on November 16, 1776, with the surrender of Fort Washington and some 2,800 men.

Vernon where he spent most of time tending the field. His health started deteriorating terribly in mid-1799, and he kicked the bucket at his home on the 14th of December, 1799. It is believed that he died of acute case of laryngitis and pneumonia. A few people know about the details of his death, which is non-essential because what really matters most are his various achievements and contributions as a leader</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">Washington was one of the men who said the country needed a new constitution. The delegates wrote the Constitution of the United States, and all the states ratified it and joined the new government.</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">George Washingtons presidency was marked by a series of firsts. He signed the first United States copyright law, protecting the copyrights of authors.</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">However, the general public did not always remember the Virginia-born Washington kindly after the War of Secession. Northerners in general preferred to remember Northern Founding Fathers such as John Adams, Alexander Hamilton and Benjamin Franklin. Nonetheless, the U.S. rebuilt the Washington Monument after it was destroyed during the Great War.</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">Washington returned to Mount Vernon and devoted his attentions to making the plantation as productive as it had been before he became president. More than four decades of public service had aged him, but he was still a commanding figure. In December 1799, he caught a cold after inspecting his properties in the rain. The cold developed into a throat infection and Washington died on the night of December 14, 1799 at the age of 67. He was entombed at Mount Vernon, which in 1960 was designated a national historic landmark</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">Growing partisanship within the government also concerned Washington. Many men in the new government -- including Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and other leaders of the emerging Republican party -- were opposed to Hamiltons financial program.</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">Growing up, George Washingtons family owned a lot of property, but they were still not considered rich in 18th-century society</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">Before 1920, the Confederate States esteemed Washington as a Founding Father as well, but generally preferred their own founding fathers such as John C. Calhoun, Jefferson Davis, and Robert E. In 1914, President Woodrow Wilson invoked George Washington in his speech asking for Congress for a declaration of war against the USA while speaking in Richmond.</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">At first Washington balked. He wanted to, at last, return to a quiet life at home and leave governing the new nation to others. But public opinion was so strong that eventually he gave in. The first presidential election was held on January 7, 1789, and Washington won handily. John Adams (1735-1826), who received the second-largest number of votes, became the nations first vice president. The 57-year-old Washington was inaugurated on April 30, 1789, in New York City. Because Washington, D.C., Americas future capital city wasnt yet built, he lived in New York and Philadelphia. While in office, he signed a bill establishing a future, permanent U.S. capital along the Potomac Riverthe city later named Washington, D.C., in his honor</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">Washington was unanimously elected as President by the Electoral College in the first two national elections. He then oversaw the creation of a strong, well-financed national government, suppressed the Whiskey Rebellion, and popularized the new Federal government. Washington was impartial with the rival parties founded by two of his cabinet secretaries: Thomas Jeffersons Democratic-Republican Party and Alexander Hamiltons Federalist Party. However he did adopt Hamiltons programs to satisfy federal and state debts, establish a permanent seat of government, implement an effective tax system, and create a national bank. When the French Revolution plunged Europe into war, Washington initially assumed a policy of neutrality, to protect American shipping abroadthough the Jay Treaty of 1795 created an alliance with Great Britain. Washingtons presidency established many precedents still in use today, such as the Cabinet system, the inaugural address, the title Mr. President, and a two-term limit precedent for future presidents. Washingtons Farewell Address was a primer on civic virtue, warning against partisanship, sectionalism, and involvement in foreign wars</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">In 1789, Washington was elected president without any competition, making him the first President of the United States. While Washington did not belong to any political party, he agreed with certain Federalist policies, such as the country should have a standing army and a national bank. He was re-elected to a second term. After his second term, Washington decided not to run for reelection, despite his popularity remaining high. His decision, to stop at 2 terms, set a precedent that every president followed until Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1940.</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">Granted statehood in 1889, Washington was named in honor of George Washington; it is the only U.S. state named after a president.

He ran as a nonpartisan candidate in the presidential elections of 1789 and 1792. To this day, Washington is the only U.S.</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">Defending New York was almost impossible. Howes army was larger, better equipped, and far better trained than Washingtons. They defeated Washingtons army at Long Islandin August and routed the Americans a few weeks later at Kips Bay, resulting in the loss of the city. Forced to retreat northward, Washington was defeated again at White Plains. The American defense of New York City came to a humiliating conclusion on November 16, 1776, with the surrender of Fort Washington and some 2,800 men. Washington ordered his army to retreat across New Jersey. The remains of his forces, mud-soaked and exhausted, crossed the Delaware River into Pennsylvania on December 7.</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">In 1734, Augustine moved the family up the Potomac River to another Washington home, Little Hunting Creek Plantation (later renamed Mount Vernon). In 1738, they moved again to Ferry Farm, a plantation on the Rappahannock River near Fredericksburg, Virginia, where George spent much of his youth.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"card shadow mb-3\"><div class=\"row no-gutters\"><div class=\"col-md-4\"><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=https://cdn0.rubylane.com/_pod/item/1959055/PBY156/George-Washington-Childrenx7827s-Book-Sam-Gabriel-full-1A-2048%3a10.10-85-f.png\" class=\"card-img\" alt=\"adf. ly books\"></div>\n<div class=\"col-md-8\"><div class=\"card-body\"><div class=\"card-header\"><h2 class=\"card-title\">George Washington - Simple English Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h2></div>\n<p class=\"card-text\">On July 3, 1754 at Fort Necessity, Washington decided to surrender after being forced to do so.

He was the one who helped build the words of the constitution. He also formed the first Presidential Cabinet with the Secretary of State and Secretary of Treasury. In his first year the Capitol of the United States was in New York City and then moved to Philadelphia. The capital of Washington was named after him, but he never served there. After 8 years of his Presidential rule, George Washington himself stepped down as he believed that a President should not rule for a very long time.A few years after leaving the office, Washington caught a bad cold and throat infection and died on 14th December 1799.</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">During Washingtons presidency, Congress passed the first federal revenue law, a tax on distilled spirits. In July 1794, farmers in Western Pennsylvania rebelled over the so-called whiskey tax.</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">If you are on a personal connection, like at home, you can run an anti-virus scan on your device to make sure it is not infected with malware.</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">George Washington (1732-99) was commander in chief of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War (1775-83) and served two terms as the first U. president, from 1789 to 1797. The son of a prosperous planter, Washington was raised in colonial Virginia. As a young man, he worked as a surveyor then fought in the French and Indian War (1754-63). During the American Revolution, he led the colonial forces to victory over the British and became a national hero. In 1787, he was elected president of the convention that wrote the U.S. Constitution. Two years later, Washington became Americas first president. Realizing that the way he handled the job would impact how future presidents approached the position, he handed down a legacy of strength, integrity and national purpose. Less than three years after leaving office, he died at his Virginia plantation, Mount Vernon, at age 67.</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">Washington was well on his way to a successful and profitable career.

Mindful that his actions would likely determine how future presidents were expected to govern, Washington worked hard to set an example of fairness, prudence and integrity. In foreign matters, he supported cordial relations with other countries but also favored a position of neutrality in foreign conflicts. Domestically, he nominated the first chief justice of the U. Supreme Court, John Jay (1745-1829), signed a bill establishing the first national bank, the Bank of the United States, and set up his own presidential cabinet.</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">Dec 29, 2015  ISBN 9780448483122  Middle Grade (8-12) Buy This format is not eligible to earn points towards the Reader Rewards program</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">In 1789, Washington was elected president without any competition, making him the first President of the United States.

He had to join in battle, fight in the revolutionary war, negotiate with opposing countries, and create a strong government. Creating a new government needs perseverance because nothing goes perfectly and as such, changes have to be made. He declined the tempting offer to be the king was offered to be king, but he denied because he wanted the United States to be a democracy with voting.</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">Washington was a delegate to the First Continental Congress, which was created by the Thirteen Colonies to respond to various laws passed by the British government. The Second Continental Congress chose him to be the commanding general of the Continental Army. After losing the big Battle of Long Island, and being chased across New Jersey, Washington led his troops back across the Delaware River on Christmas Day, 1776, in a surprise attack on Hessian mercenaries at the small Battle of Princeton and Trenton, New Jersey. The British had more troops and more supplies than Washington, however, Washington kept his troops together and won these small battles.</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">On January 6th, 1759, Washington married Martha Dandridge Custis, a charming and vivacious young woman from the Tidewater area of Virginia. Martha brought enormous wealth, along with two small children, Jacky and Patsy, to the marriage. It was her second marriage, his first.About two weeks after the battle at Yorktown, Washingtons stepson, John Parke Custis(Jacky), died of camp fever at the age of 27. Ironically, the spoiled and indolent young man had not fought in the war but had, at its end, traveled to Yorktown to serve as a civilian aide to his stepfather. He was the last of Marthas remaining children. His sister Patsyhad died as a teenager eight years earlier following an epileptic seizure.Martha Washington joined her husband in his winter quarters every year of the war. Together they entertained his officers and guests. A patriot in her own right, Mrs. Washington made it her war too, nursing sick and wounded soldiers and raising money for the troops. Needlework helped her to pass the time through the long, cold winters. In all, she would spend about half the war in camp.Two of Martha Washingtons grandchildren, Eleanor (Nelly) Parke Custis(b. 1779) and George Washington (Washy) Parke Custis(b. 1781) came to live with their grandparents after their father died following the Battle of Yorktown. Washington loved his step-grandchildren as his very own.</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">Washington was one of the men who said the country needed a new constitution. The delegates wrote the Constitution of the United States, and all the states ratified it and joined the new government.</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">It is a common misconception that George Washington had wooden teeth, as false teeth.[9] He did, however, try many different ways to replace his teeth, including having teeth carved from elks teeth or ivory.[10][11]Ivory and bone both have hairline fractures in them, which normally cannot be seen, but started to darken due to Washingtons use of wine. The darkened, thin fractures in the bone made the lines look like the grain in a piece of wood.[12] George Washingtons teeth started falling out when he was about 22 years old, and he had only one tooth left by the time he became president. At one time, he had false teeth with a special hole so the one tooth he still had could poke through.[10][11] He tried to keep them smelling clean by soaking them in wine, but instead they became mushy and black.[10][11] In 1796, a dentist had to pull out George Washingtons last tooth, and he kept his tooth in a gold locket attached to his watch chain.[10] When the time came for the president to have his portrait painted, cotton was pushed under his lips to make him look as if he had teeth.[10][11] The cotton made his mouth puff out, as is seen on the picture on the US 1 bill.[11]</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">Washington emerged as the top leader when the time came for voters to select their first leader in 1789.S. was unanimous. His second term in 1792 was also voted unanimously by the American people who believed in his leadership. Even though he accomplished a lot during his eight-year presidency, the Bill of Rights which was adopted in 1791 is considered as his most paramount accomplishment was that of the Bill of Rights. Peoples admiration only got stronger when he refused to serve a third term. In his farewell speech, he explained that serving in a third term can only give one leader too much power.</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">From his marriage, George Washington owned a substantial amount of farm land, where he grew tobacco, wheat, and vegetables. Washington also owned more than 100 slaves, who were freed upon his death. He did not have much money in cash and had to borrow money while he was president.</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">In short, yes. Washington was born into a Virginia planter family. After his fathers death in 1743, Washington inherited 10 slaves. In 1761 Washington acquired a farmhouse (which he later expanded to a five-farm estate) called Mount Vernon. In 1760, 49 slaves lived and worked on the estate; by 1799 that number had increased to over 300. The majority of the slaves that lived on Mount Vernon did not belong to Washington; most were dower slaves, received upon marriage. Washington eventually freed the 123 slaves he owned.</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">Washington left one of the most enduring legacies of any American in history.S. dollar bill and quarter, and dozens of U.S. schools, towns and counties, as well as the state of Washington and the nations capital city, are named for him.</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">General George Washington Resigning His Commission by John Trumbull, Capitol Rotunda (commissioned 1817)</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">General Washington leads the Continental Army to victory; defeating the British, and ensuring independence</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">Washingtons mother was Mary Ball Washington and his father was Augustine Washington.

His first term (1789-1793) was occupied primarily with organizing the executive branch of the new government and establishing administrative procedures that would make it possible for the government to operate with the energy and efficiency he believed were essential to the republics future. An astute judge of talent, he surrounded himself with the most able men in the new nation. He appointed his former aide-decamp,Alexander Hamilton, as Secretary of the Treasury;Thomas Jeffersonas Secretary of State; and his former artillery chief, Henry Knox, as Secretary of War. James Madison was one of his principal advisors</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">The Washington Family by Edward Savage, painted between 1789 and 1796, shows (from left to right): George Washington Parke Custis, George Washington, Eleanor Parke Custis, Martha Washington, and an enslaved servant, probably William Lee or Christopher Sheels.</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">This worksheet can be edited by Premium members using the free Google Slides online software.

By 1759, Washington had resigned his commission, returned to Mount Vernon and was elected to the Virginia House of Burgesses, where he served until 1774. In January 1759, he married Martha Dandridge Custis (1731-1802), a wealthy widow with two children. Washington became a devoted stepfather to her children; he and Martha Washington never had any offspring of their own.</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">Inspirational WomenWomens History MonthFirst Lady of the USWomens Equality DayInternational Womens Day</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">In 1787, Washington ended his self-imposed retirement and traveled to Philadelphia to attend a convention assembled to recommend changes to the Articles of Confederation. He was unanimously chosen to preside over theConstitutional Convention, a job that took four months. He spoke very little in the convention, but few delegates were more determined to devise a government endowed with real energy and authority. My wish, he wrote, is that the convention may adopt no temporizing expedients but probe the defects of the Constitution to the bottom and provide a radical cure</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">One of George Washingtons greatest qualities as a leader was perseverance. He pursued his various endeavours in life with perseverance, beginning with self-education after he was prohibited from attending school. Self-education is not a small feat because it can take a lot of patience and perseverance especially during desperate times. A determined person would hardly get frustrated even if he lacked the knowledge to do his task or he couldnt figure something out.</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">The story that Washington threw a silver dollar across the Potomac River -- an impossible feat -- had its origins in the recollections of a cousin that George could throw a stone across the much narrower Rappahannock River</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">On December 23, 1783, Washington presented himself before Congress in Annapolis, Maryland, and resigned his commission. LikeCincinnatus, the hero of Classical antiquity whose conduct he most admired, Washington had the wisdom to give up power when he could have been crowned a king. He left Annapolis and went home to Mount Vernon with the fixed intention of never again serving in public life.</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">But others, including the familiar story of Washington and the cherry tree, seem to have been invented by one of Washingtons first biographers, Mason Locke Weems.</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">When George Washington was eleven years old, his father Augustine died, leaving most of his property to Georges older half brothers. The income from what remained was just sufficient to maintain Mary Washington and her children. As the oldest child remaining at home, George undoubtedly helped his mother manage the Rappahannock River plantation where they lived.</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">Who HQis your headquarters for history</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">The Freedom Party in its earliest phase, while still under Anthony Dresser, used George Washingtons picture as an emblem, with the slogan We need a New Revolution. Many Confederates did view Washington with some suspicion in the years after the Great War, but still thought of him as a Virginian first, and President of the United States second. Washington University in Lexington, Virginia, home of the Confederacys effort to build a superbomb, retained its name, and the statue of Washington that stood in Richmond survived both Great Wars.</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">Even as President, Washingtons thoughts often turned to Mount Vernon. As horses circled the second floor, they treaded on the wheat that had been spread there, breaking the grain from the chaff. The wheat would fall through gaps in the floorboards to the first floor, where it was winnowed. After winnowing, the grain was taken to the gristmill and ground into flour. From the Presidents House in Philadelphia, Washington followed the barns construction every step of the way. He even correctly calculated the number of bricks needed for the first floor  which turned out to be exactly 30,820</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">Mount Vernon is owned and maintained in trust for the people of the United States by the Mount Vernon Ladies Association of the Union, a private, non-profit organization. We dont accept government funding and rely upon private contributions to help preserve George Washingtons home and legacy.</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">Succeeding President John Adams appointed the retired Washington Lieutenant General of a Provisional Army in the Quasi-War with the French. In his will he directed the manumission of all his 124 slaves, to promote the end of slavery. Scholarly and public polling ranks him among the top three presidents in history, and he is honored by countless monuments, public works, place names, stamps, and currency.</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">Copyright  2012  Totallyhistory.

But as Washingtons first term ended, a bloody Indian war continued on the northwestern frontier. The warring tribes were encouraged by the British, who retained military posts in the northwest.

During the remaining months of the next year, he lost New York City to the British but they evaded capture since he successfully evacuated his troops. In an attempt to take Trenton from the British, Washington and his men crossed the Delaware River on Christmas night of 1776.

Washington assumed the Presidency on the eve of the French Revolution, a time of great international crisis. The outbreak of a general European war in 1793 forced the crisis to the center of American politics. Washington believed the national interest of the United States dictated neutrality. The countrys future depended on the increase in wealth and opportunity that would come from commerce and westward expansion. One of Washingtons most important accomplishments was keeping the United States out of the war, giving the new nation an opportunity to grow in strength while establishing the principle of neutrality that shaped American foreign policy for more than a century. Although Washingtons department heads agreed that the United States should remain neutral, disagreements over foreign policy aggravated partisan tensions among them. The disagreements were part of the deepening division between Federalists and Republicans. Opposition to federal policies developed into resistance to the law in 1794as distillers in Western Pennsylvania rioted and refused to pay taxes. Washington directed the army to restore order, a step applauded by Federalists and condemned by Republicans.</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">This sample is exclusively for KidsKonnect membersTo download this worksheet, click the button below to signup for free (it only takes a minute) and youll be brought right back to this page to start the downloadSign Me Up</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">Washington became a farmer like his father.

The Second Continental Congress chose him to be the commanding general of the Continental Army. Washington led the army from 1775 until the end of the war in 1783. After losing the big Battle of Long Island, and being chased across New Jersey, Washington led his troops back across the Delaware River on Christmas Day, 1776, in a surprise attack on Hessian mercenaries at the small Battle of Princeton and Trenton, New Jersey.

He did, however, try many different ways to replace his teeth, including having teeth carved from elks teeth or ivory. Ivory and bone both have hairline fractures in them, which normally cannot be seen, but started to darken due to Washingtons use of wine. The darkened, thin fractures in the bone made the lines look like the grain in a piece of wood. George Washingtons teeth started falling out when he was about 22 years old, and he had only one tooth left by the time he became president. It was difficult for him to talk or to eat. At one time, he had false teeth with a special hole so the one tooth he still had could poke through. He tried to keep them smelling clean by soaking them in wine, but instead they became mushy and black. In 1796, a dentist had to pull out George Washingtons last tooth, and he kept his tooth in a gold locket attached to his watch chain. When the time came for the president to have his portrait painted, cotton was pushed under his lips to make him look as if he had teeth.</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">EasterSaint Patricks Day Valentines DayChinese New YearRosh Hashanah ThanksgivingFlag DayCinco de MayoBeginning Of LentYom KippurView all celebrations worksheets</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">Washington was present during the 1787 Constitutional Convention which was held in Philadelphia Pennsylvania.

He watched with mounting dismay as the weak union created by the Articles of Confederation gradually disintegrated, unable to collect revenue or pay its debts. He was appalled by the excesses of the state legislatures and frustrated by the diplomatic, financial, and military impotence of the Confederation Congress.

His father and older brother decided to have him home-schooled but both died when he was only eleven years old. Through self-education and dedication, he became an expert woodsman and mapmaker. He got married in 1759 to a rich widow named Martha Curtis. The couple didnt have children of their own although Curtis had two children who were from her previous marriage.</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">For much of the remainder of the war, Washingtons most important strategic task was to keep the British bottled up in New York.

He was offered a government position that would have been considered a dictatorship over the colonies, but in a surprising move, Washington refused, left the army, and returned to Mount Vernon. He wanted the colonies to have a strong government but did not wish to head that government, nor did he want the colonies to be run by a tyrant.</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">In 1798, George Washington was again commissioned as Commander in Chief of the Army, a title he held until his death 18 months later.</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">In the political aspect, George Washington proved to be an excellent leader throughout his career and his entire life. Being a leader of a democratic government which he pioneered himself, his responsibilities were countless and challenging. Dictatorship didnt appeal to him at all, which was in contrast to most leaders during his time. Some of the qualities that a great leader possesses are perseverance and courage. George Washington had both. There were numerous moments in his life when he had to persevere and be courageous and such moments defined him not only as a leader but also a person.</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">In 1783, with the signing of the Treaty of Paris between Great Britain and the U.S., Washington, believing he had done his duty, gave up his command of the army and returned to Mount Vernon, intent on resuming his life as a gentleman farmer and family man. However, in 1787, he was asked to attend the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia and head the committee to draft the new constitution. His impressive leadership there convinced the delegates that he was by far the most qualified man to become the nations first president.</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">Washington went back home to Mount Vernon (Virginia) after his second term ended in 1797.

Brave people have the courage to teach themselves as nobody can come to the rescue if youre stuck with something. At some point in his life, Washington might have been stuck and there was nowhere to run to get help so, he would essential rely on himself and try hard to get everything right. With self-education, learning can be pretty hard. When youre in school, you can easily get help from the teacher who can help you keep on track.</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">On Thursday, December 12, 1799, George Washington was out on horseback supervising farming activities from late morning until three in the afternoon. The weather shifted from light snow to hail and then to rain. Upon Washingtons return it was suggested that he change out of his wet riding clothes before dinner. Known for his punctuality, Washington chose to remain in his damp attire</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">In 1753 the Governor of Virginia, Robert Dinwiddie, learned that French troops had moved south from Canada and were constructing forts in the region south of Lake Erie, an area claimed by Virginia (but now in Western Pennsylvania). Both France and England recognized the commercial potential of the region. This point, now Pittsburgh, was the eastern gateway to the Ohio Valley.In the fall of 1753 Dinwiddie sent 21-year-old Major Washington to deliver a message to the French, demanding they leave the area. With the help of a frontier guide and local Indians, Washington reached the French fort, Le Boeuf, with Dinwiddies message. The return trip tested Washingtons endurance. He hiked for days through snowy woods, fell off a raft into the ice-choked Allegheny River, nearly drowned, and was forced to spend a freezing night on an island without shelter. His guide, an experienced backwoodsman, suffered frostbite; but Washington suffered no ill effects. Washingtons account of the arduous 900-mile journey was published by Governor Dinwiddie in both Williamsburg and London, establishing an international reputation for George Washington by the time he was 22.</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">If you are at an office or shared network, you can ask the network administrator to run a scan across the network looking for misconfigured or infected devices</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">Over the course of the grueling eight-year war, the colonial forces won few battles but consistently held their own against the British.

In May 1775 Washington was declared as the General of the Continental Army. It was a tough time as George Washington had to train an army of colonial farmers to fight against trained British soldiers. He lost many battles during the American Revolution that went on for six years.On 25 December 1776, George Washington, with his Continental Army, crossed the Delaware River into New Jersey for a surprise attack on the British Army. This was a turning point in Americas favor.The Battle of Yorktown was the last battle of the American Revolution. Thus the British decided to surrender and also considered a peace treaty. Thus George Washington succeeded in leading his army to victory over the British on October 17, 1781.</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">George Washington was only 21 years old when he made a perilous journey across the Allegheny Mountains to command the French to withdraw from the Ohio region claimed by King George II.</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">Another great quality of George Washington was his admirable courage. In most history books, George Washington is described as a courageous leader. Being in the Revolutionary War means braveness, audacity and courage because we are defending our country against those who want to take it away from us.

Washington and the King were immortalised in a Thomas Gainsborough painting entitled The Two Georges, which came to symbolise the friendship between the North American Union and the Kingdom of Great Britain. In his later career as the Governor-General of the North American Union, Washington implemented a policy which halted for some decades the westward expansion of White settlement and gave some Red Indian tribes, such as the Iroquois and the Cherokees, the chance to modernise and consolidate ownership of much of their lands. For that reason he was greatly revered by the Indians, and the Iroquois believed him to be the only white person admitted to their religions version of Heaven</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">Despite Washingtons disappointment with the rise of partisanship, the last years of his Presidency were distinguished by important achievements. The long Indian war on the northwest frontier was won, Britain surrendered its forts in the northwest, and Spain opened the Mississippi to American commerce. These achievements opened the West to settlement. Washingtons Farewell Addresshelped to summarize many of Washingtons strongest held beliefs about what it would take to sustain and grow the young nation that he helped found.</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">Instead they decided to strike at the British army under Cornwallis, which was camped atYorktown, Virginia. Washingtons planning for the Battle of Yorktownwas as bold as it had been for Trenton and Princeton but on a much larger scale. Depending on Clintons inactivity, Washington marched south to lay siege on Cornwallis. On October 19, 1781, he accepted the surrender of Cornwalliss army.

Moreover, gaining independence doesnt happen overnight, so changes have to be made in order for the desired independence to be gained. Lastly, any attempt at gaining independence means having to argue and convince majority of people by making them understand why independence is needed</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">Additional Information Because of his significant role in the revolution and in the formation of the United States, Washington is often referred to as Father of His Country</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">Every American knows that George Washington was the first president of the United States of America. It is a name known by every American citizen and of all other figures and personalities throughout the history of the United States. His name is arguably the one that is most commonly associated with the very foundation of America. But what most people may not be aware of is that apart from being the first president of the country, he also had various achievements in military and politics to the extent that he is a much-admired individual in several aspects.

While his two older half-brothers went to England to pursue education, he stayed at home. In fact, he never had any experience of going to college or studying an additional language. It can be said that his education ended when he was about 16 years old. History couldnt tell for sure about who taught Washington or where he attended school. The only proof that he got some education was his school papers.In his own words, Washington described his education as something that was defective. Although his education continued all through the rest of his life, the fact that his formal education was short-lived made him a very self-conscious individual. Books, studying the people he respected, and learning from others were among the ways he was able to learn.</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">During his first term Washington toured the northern and southern states and found that the new government enjoyed the general support of the American people. But his cabinet members convinced him that he alone could command the respect of members of both burgeoning political parties. Thomas Jefferson visited Washington at Mount Vernon to urge him to accept a second term. Although longing to return home permanently, Washington reluctantly agreed.</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">In 1795, Washington signed the Treaty of Amity Commerce and Navigation, between His Britannic Majesty; and The United States of America, or Jays Treaty, so-named for John Jay, who had negotiated it with the government of King George III. It helped the U. avoid war with Great Britain, but also rankled certain members of Congress back home and was fiercely opposed by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison. Internationally, it caused a stir among the French, who believed it violated previous treaties between the United States and France.</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">FACT CHECK: We strive for accuracy and fairness.

Over the last 200 years revolutionary leaders in every part of the world have employed this insight, but never with a result as startling as Washingtons victory over the British.</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">A few months later Dinwiddie dispatched Washington, now a lieutenant colonel, and some 150 men to assert Virginias claims. Washington then retreated to an ill-placed and makeshift palisade he called Fort Necessity. He was forced to surrender when the French surrounded the fort. The campaign ended in humiliation for Washington and ignited the French and Indian War.Although he resigned his commission after the surrender, Washington returned to the frontier in 1755 as a volunteer aide to General Edward Braddock. Braddock had been sent by the King of England to drive the French from the Ohio Country. Braddocks army was routed near the Monongahela Riverand fled in confusion to Virginia. During the battle, while attempting to rally the British soldiers, Washington had two horses shot out from under him and four bullet holes shot through his coat. Although he behaved with conspicuous bravery, Washington could do little except lead the broken survivors to safety.In recognition of his conduct, Washington was given command of Virginias entire military force. With a few hundred men he was ordered to protect a frontier some 350 miles long. Although this was a frustrating assignment, it provided him with experience in commanding troops through an arduous campaign. In 1758 the British finally took the forks of the Ohio.

His strength lay not in his genius on the battlefield but in his ability to keep the struggling colonial army together.

He was sent several times to the forks of the Ohio River, now called Pittsburgh. His job was to get rid of the French who were trying to take control of the Ohio River Valley.</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">George Washington was a hero to both the United States and the Confederacy. In the CSA, his birthday was celebrated fondly, and a statue of him stood proudly in Capitol Square in Richmond.

Shortly after their arrival, George contracted smallpox. He survived, although the illness left him with permanent facial scars. Washington eventually inherited Lawrences estate, Mount Vernon, on the Potomac River near Alexandria, Virginia.</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">George Washington basically challenged himself to read books and use common sense to understand what the book was saying. You can imagine how he would have to read everything over and over to fully understand the thought or idea written on the book he was reading. If for instance he was trying to solve a mathematical problem and didnt know the correct answer, he would resort to asking the people in his household, but if they didnt have the correct answer themselves, George would need to try harder and persevere so he could learn.</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">Over the years, Washington enlarged his house. First he raised the roof to create a third floor. Later he would add a wing to both ends, build a piazza overlooking the Potomac River, and crown his vision with a pediment and cupola.

One pair of stones ground corn into meal for use at Mount Vernon and the other ground wheat into superfine flour for export to foreign ports. Washington also began making whiskey on the advice of his farm manager, James Anderson, a trained distiller from Scotland. He soon built one of the largest distilleries in America.

His education included surveying which launched his early career as a surveyor. The Second Continental Congress made him commander-in-chief of the Continental Army in 1775. Washingtons strategy, field command, and development of the army, combined with an alliance with France, were crucial in defeating the British, who surrendered after the Siege of Yorktown. In 1783, the victorious Washington declined further power and resigned as commander-in-chief, affirming his devotion to American Republicanism. He was unanimously chosen to lead the Constitutional Convention in 1787 which devised the new Federal government.</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">Once the Constitution was approved, Washington hoped to retire again to private life.

George started working as a surveyor of lands but later he became a leader with the Virginia armed force and became involved in the war with the French and Indians.

Vernon where he spent most of time tending the field. His health started deteriorating terribly in mid-1799, and he kicked the bucket at his home on the 14th of December, 1799. It is believed that he died of acute case of laryngitis and pneumonia. A few people know about the details of his death, which is non-essential because what really matters most are his various achievements and contributions as a leader</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">Washington was one of the men who said the country needed a new constitution. The delegates wrote the Constitution of the United States, and all the states ratified it and joined the new government.</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">George Washingtons presidency was marked by a series of firsts. He signed the first United States copyright law, protecting the copyrights of authors.</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">However, the general public did not always remember the Virginia-born Washington kindly after the War of Secession. Northerners in general preferred to remember Northern Founding Fathers such as John Adams, Alexander Hamilton and Benjamin Franklin. Nonetheless, the U.S. rebuilt the Washington Monument after it was destroyed during the Great War.</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">Washington returned to Mount Vernon and devoted his attentions to making the plantation as productive as it had been before he became president. More than four decades of public service had aged him, but he was still a commanding figure. In December 1799, he caught a cold after inspecting his properties in the rain. The cold developed into a throat infection and Washington died on the night of December 14, 1799 at the age of 67. He was entombed at Mount Vernon, which in 1960 was designated a national historic landmark</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">Growing partisanship within the government also concerned Washington. Many men in the new government -- including Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and other leaders of the emerging Republican party -- were opposed to Hamiltons financial program.</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">Growing up, George Washingtons family owned a lot of property, but they were still not considered rich in 18th-century society</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">Before 1920, the Confederate States esteemed Washington as a Founding Father as well, but generally preferred their own founding fathers such as John C. Calhoun, Jefferson Davis, and Robert E. In 1914, President Woodrow Wilson invoked George Washington in his speech asking for Congress for a declaration of war against the USA while speaking in Richmond.</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">At first Washington balked. He wanted to, at last, return to a quiet life at home and leave governing the new nation to others. But public opinion was so strong that eventually he gave in. The first presidential election was held on January 7, 1789, and Washington won handily. John Adams (1735-1826), who received the second-largest number of votes, became the nations first vice president. The 57-year-old Washington was inaugurated on April 30, 1789, in New York City. Because Washington, D.C., Americas future capital city wasnt yet built, he lived in New York and Philadelphia. While in office, he signed a bill establishing a future, permanent U.S. capital along the Potomac Riverthe city later named Washington, D.C., in his honor</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">Washington was unanimously elected as President by the Electoral College in the first two national elections. He then oversaw the creation of a strong, well-financed national government, suppressed the Whiskey Rebellion, and popularized the new Federal government. Washington was impartial with the rival parties founded by two of his cabinet secretaries: Thomas Jeffersons Democratic-Republican Party and Alexander Hamiltons Federalist Party. However he did adopt Hamiltons programs to satisfy federal and state debts, establish a permanent seat of government, implement an effective tax system, and create a national bank. When the French Revolution plunged Europe into war, Washington initially assumed a policy of neutrality, to protect American shipping abroadthough the Jay Treaty of 1795 created an alliance with Great Britain. Washingtons presidency established many precedents still in use today, such as the Cabinet system, the inaugural address, the title Mr. President, and a two-term limit precedent for future presidents. Washingtons Farewell Address was a primer on civic virtue, warning against partisanship, sectionalism, and involvement in foreign wars</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">In 1789, Washington was elected president without any competition, making him the first President of the United States. While Washington did not belong to any political party, he agreed with certain Federalist policies, such as the country should have a standing army and a national bank. He was re-elected to a second term. After his second term, Washington decided not to run for reelection, despite his popularity remaining high.

Howes army was larger, better equipped, and far better trained than Washingtons. They defeated Washingtons army at Long Islandin August and routed the Americans a few weeks later at Kips Bay, resulting in the loss of the city. Forced to retreat northward, Washington was defeated again at White Plains. The American defense of New York City came to a humiliating conclusion on November 16, 1776, with the surrender of Fort Washington and some 2,800 men. Washington ordered his army to retreat across New Jersey. The remains of his forces, mud-soaked and exhausted, crossed the Delaware River into Pennsylvania on December 7.</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\">In 1734, Augustine moved the family up the Potomac River to another Washington home, Little Hunting Creek Plantation (later renamed Mount Vernon).

The son of a prosperous planter, Washington was raised in colonial Virginia. As a young man, he worked as a surveyor then fought in the French and Indian War (1754-63). During the American Revolution, he led the colonial forces to victory over the British and became a national hero. In 1787, he was elected president of the convention that wrote the U.S. Constitution. Two years later, Washington became Americas first president.

In foreign matters, he supported cordial relations with other countries but also favored a position of neutrality in foreign conflicts. Domestically, he nominated the first chief justice of the U.
