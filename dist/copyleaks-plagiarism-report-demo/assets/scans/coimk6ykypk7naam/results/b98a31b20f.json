With the Second Wave, women were looking through a social-justice lens that was made clear through the efforts around Civil Rights. It is important to look at the societal climate for women in the 60s to realize the “battle” that took place so here are a few timeline bits for reference:\n\n\nIn 1962, New York domestic violence cases were transferred from criminal court to civil court, where only civil procedures apply. A man’s penalty was not as harsh for assaulting his wife as they were if he was found guilty in criminal court for assaulting a stranger.\n\n\nThis is remnant to the Marital Chastisement common law and demonstrates continued minimization of violence from men toward their wives.\n\n\nIn 1963, writer and feminist Betty Friedan published The Feminine Mystique, a nonfiction book in which she contested the post-World War II belief that it was women’s destiny to marry and bear children. Friedan’s book was a best-seller and began to raise the consciousness of many women who agreed that homemaking in the suburbs sapped them of their individualism and left them unsatisfied.\n\n\nIn 1965, The US Supreme Court determines that married couples are legally allowed to use contraception.\n\n\nThe fact that the highest court in our nation had to rule on such a private health and family issue should be an amazement to everyone. The historical context that is essential is the fact that women, prior to this time, were subject to their husband for permission for health care of any kind. This was a part of coverture – women being “covered by man” through marriage. Married women had no rights to their bodies. That meant that not only would a husband have a claim to any wages generated by his wife’s labor or to the fruits of her body (her children), but he also had an absolute right to sexual access. Within marriage, a wife’s consent was implied, so under the law, all sex-related activity, including rape, was legitimate. Of course, a man wasn’t allowed to beat his wife to death, but he could beat her.\n\n\nIn 1966, beating as cruel and inhumane treatment becomes grounds for divorce in New York, but the plaintiff (woman) must establish that a “sufficient” number of beatings have taken place.\n\n\nIn 1966, the National Organization for Women (NOW), formed and proceeded to set an agenda for the feminist movement. Framed by a statement of purpose written by Friedan, the agenda began by proclaiming NOW’s goal to make possible women’s participation in all aspects of American life and to gain for them all the rights enjoyed by men. Among the specific goals set was the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), a proposed Constitutional Amendment guaranteeing equal rights for women. First introduced in Congress in 1923, written by Alice Paul who stated, “Men and women shall have equal rights throughout the United States and every place subject to its jurisdiction. Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.”\n\n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n            \n\n\n    The ERA was finally passed in 1972 but failed to receive the 38 state ratifications necessary to become part of the Constitution. It has yet to be adopted today.\n\n\nWomen today must be reminded what we overcame and the context that caused the Women’s Movement to be necessary. Misogyny, Sexism, and Chauvinism are alive and breathing in our society. They are not yet “relics” of the past.  Therefore we must understand where we have come from in order to defend where we stand today and to garner the energy and passion to keep moving forward!\n\n\nFor more reading:  http://www.nwhp.org/resources/womens-rights-movement/history-of-the-womens-rights-movement/  or  http://msmagazine.com/blog/2013/05/28/10-things-that-american-women-could-not-do-before-the-1970s/\n\n\nUntil next Monday Matters – Peace, Laura\n\n\n        \n\n      \n      \n              \n          \n            \n              \n            \n\n          \n\n          \n            News &amp; Events\n          \n\n\n          \n          \n            \n                                                                                    \n\n        \n        \n            \n        \n            Newsroom\n\n            \n        \n\n\n\n        \n            Events\n\n            \n        \n\n\n\n        \n            Join Our Mailing List\n\n            \n        \n\n\n\n        \n            Important Links\n\n            \n        \n\n\n\n        \n            DIVA!

We provide the same protections for these electronic communications that we employ in the maintenance of information received by mail and telephone.\n\n\nWebsite Use Information\nSimilar to other websites, our site may utilize a standard technology called \"cookies\" (see explanation below, \"What Are Cookies?\") and web server logs to collect information about how our website is used. Information gathered through cookies and server logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our website, and the sites visited just before and just after ours. This information is collected on an aggregate basis. None of this information is associated with you as an individual.\n\n\nHow Do We Use the Information That You Provide to Us?\nBroadly speaking, we use personal information for purposes of administering our business activities, providing service and support and making available other products and services to our customers and prospective customers. Occasionally, we may also use the information we collect to notify you about important changes to our website, new services and special offers we think you will find valuable. The lists used to send you product and service offers are developed and managed under our traditional standards designed to safeguard the security and privacy of all personal information provided by our users. You may at any time to notify us of your desire not to receive these offers.\n\n\nWhat Are Cookies?\nCookies are a feature of web browser software that allows web servers to recognize the computer used to access a website. Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored by a user's web browser on the user's hard drive. Cookies can remember what information a user accesses on one web page to simplify subsequent interactions with that website by the same user or to use the information to streamline the user's transactions on related web pages. This makes it easier for a user to move from web page to web page and to complete commercial transactions over the Internet. Cookies should make your online experience easier and more personalized.\n\n\nHow Do We Use Information Collected From Cookies?\nWe use website browser software tools such as cookies and web server logs to gather information about our website users' browsing activities, in order to constantly improve our website and better serve our users. This information assists us to design and arrange our web pages in the most user-friendly manner and to continually improve our website to better meet the needs of our users and prospective users.\nCookies help us collect important business and technical statistics. The information in the cookies lets us trace the paths followed by users to our website as they move from one page to another. Web server logs allow us to count how many people visit our website and evaluate our website's visitor capacity. We do not use these technologies to capture your individual email address or any personally identifying information about you.\n\n\nNotice of New Services and Changes\nOccasionally, we may use the information we collect to notify you about important changes to our website, new services and special offers we think you will find valuable. As a user of our website, you will be given the opportunity to notify us of your desire not to receive these offers by clicking on a response box when you receive such an offer or by sending us an email request.\n\n\nHow Do We Secure Information Transmissions?\nWhen you send confidential personal information to us on our website, a secure server software which we have licensed encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. The information is scrambled en route and decoded once it reaches our website.\nOther email that you may send to us may not be secure unless we advise you that security measures will be in place prior to your transmitting the information. For that reason, we ask that you do not send confidential information such as Social Security, credit card, or account numbers to us through an unsecured email.\n\n\nHow Do We Protect Your Information?\nInformation Security -- We utilize encryption/security software to safeguard the confidentiality of personal information we collect from unauthorized access or disclosure and accidental loss, alteration or destruction.\nEvaluation of Information Protection Practices -- Periodically, our operations and business practices are reviewed for compliance with organization policies and procedures governing the security, confidentiality and quality of our information.\nEmployee Access, Training and Expectations -- Our organization values, ethical standards, policies and practices are committed to the protection of user information. In general, our business practices limit employee access to confidential information, and limit the use and disclosure of such information to authorized persons, processes and transactions.\n\n\nHow Can You Access and Correct Your Information?\nYou may request access to all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain in our database by emailing us using the contact form provided to you within the site structure of our website.\n\n\nDo We Disclose Information to Outside Parties?\nWe may provide aggregate information about our customers, sales, website traffic patterns and related website information to our affiliates or reputable third parties, but this information will not include personally identifying data, except as otherwise provided in this privacy policy.\n\n\nWhat About Legally Compelled Disclosure of Information?\nWe may disclose information when legally compelled to do so, in other words, when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires it or for the protection of our legal rights.\n\n\nPermission to Use of Materials\nThe right to download and store or output the materials in our website is granted for the user's personal use only, and materials may not be reproduced in any edited form. Any other reproduction, transmission, performance, display or editing of these materials by any means mechanical or electronic without our express written permission is strictly prohibited.

the abolitionist movement made nineteenth-century women more aware of their lack of power and encouraged them to form the first women’s rights movement–sometimes called first-wave feminism–the protest movements of the 1960s inspired many women to create their own organized movement for greater rights–known as second-wave feminism. With the Second Wave, women were looking through a social-justice lens that was made clear through the efforts around Civil Rights. It is important to look at the societal climate for women in the 60s to realize the “battle” that took place so here are a few timeline bits for reference:</p>\n\n\n<p>In 1962, New York domestic violence cases were transferred from criminal court to civil court, where only civil procedures apply. A man’s penalty was not as harsh for assaulting his wife as they were if he was found guilty in criminal court for assaulting a stranger.</p>\n\n\n<p>This is remnant to the Marital Chastisement common law and demonstrates continued minimization of violence from men toward their wives.</p>\n\n\n<p>In 1963, writer and feminist Betty Friedan published The Feminine Mystique, a nonfiction book in which she contested the post-World War II belief that it was women’s destiny to marry and bear children. Friedan’s book was a best-seller and began to raise the consciousness of many women who agreed that homemaking in the suburbs sapped them of their individualism and left them unsatisfied.</p>\n\n\n<p>In 1965, The US Supreme Court determines that married couples are legally allowed to use contraception.</p>\n\n\n<p>The fact that the highest court in our nation had to rule on such a private health and family issue should be an amazement to everyone. The historical context that is essential is the fact that women, prior to this time, were subject to their husband for permission for health care of any kind. This was a part of coverture – women being “covered by man” through marriage. Married women had no rights to their bodies. That meant that not only would a husband have a claim to any wages generated by his wife’s labor or to the fruits of her body (her children), but he also had an absolute right to sexual access. Within marriage, a wife’s consent was implied, so under the law, all sex-related activity, including rape, was legitimate. Of course, a man wasn’t allowed to beat his wife to death, but he could beat her.</p>\n\n\n<p>In 1966, beating as cruel and inhumane treatment becomes grounds for divorce in New York, but the plaintiff (woman) must establish that a “sufficient” number of beatings have taken place.</p>\n\n\n<p>In 1966, the <strong>National Organization for Women (NOW)</strong>, formed and proceeded to set an agenda for the feminist movement. Framed by a statement of purpose written by Friedan, the agenda began by proclaiming NOW’s goal to make possible women’s participation in all aspects of American life and to gain for them all the rights enjoyed by men. Among the specific goals set was the passage of the <strong>Equal Rights Amendment (ERA)</strong>, a proposed Constitutional Amendment guaranteeing equal rights for women. First introduced in Congress in 1923, written by Alice Paul who stated, “Men and women shall have equal rights throughout the United States and every place subject to its jurisdiction. Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.”</p>\n\n        <div id=\"content_a9ed14ff77ba6b96d8bc6f00ae82c427\" class=\"image\" style=\"max-width: 300px;\">\n        \n        <img width=\"300\" height=\"167\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=https://cdn.firespring.com/images/962a2fbb-b0ac-48fb-b74c-753ef0ed827a.png\" srcset=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=https://cdn.firespring.com/images/962a2fbb-b0ac-48fb-b74c-753ef0ed827a.png 300w\" itemprop=\"image\">\n        \n\n            </div>\n\n\n    <p>The ERA was finally passed in 1972 but failed to receive the 38 state ratifications necessary to become part of the Constitution. It has yet to be adopted today.</p>\n\n\n<p>Women today must be reminded what we overcame and the context that caused the Women’s Movement to be necessary. Misogyny, Sexism, and Chauvinism are alive and breathing in our society. They are not yet “relics” of the past.  Therefore we must understand where we have come from in order to defend where we stand today and to garner the energy and passion to keep moving forward!</p>\n\n\n<p>For more reading:  <a href=\"http://www.nwhp.org/resources/womens-rights-movement/history-of-the-womens-rights-movement/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.nwhp.org/resources/womens-rights-movement/history-of-the-womens-rights-movement/</a>  or  <a href=\"http://msmagazine.com/blog/2013/05/28/10-things-that-american-women-could-not-do-before-the-1970s/\" target=\"_blank\">http://msmagazine.com/blog/2013/05/28/10-things-that-american-women-could-not-do-before-the-1970s/</a></p>\n\n\n<p>Until next Monday Matters – Peace, Laura</p>\n\n\n        </div>\n\n      \n      \n              <div class=\"sidebar-container\">\n          <div class=\"sidebar-trigger\">\n            <div class=\"sidebar-arrow\">\n              <i class=\"fa fa-angle-left\"></i>\n            </div>\n\n          </div>\n\n          <div class=\"section-title\">\n            <h3>News &amp; Events</h3>\n          </div>\n\n\n          \n          \n            \n                                                                                    <nav class=\"nav nav_section_root subnav \" role=\"navigation\" aria-label=\"Secondary Navigation\">\n\n        \n        <ul class=\"nav__list nav-ul-0 nav subnav \">\n            \n        <li class=\"nav-level-0\">\n            <a href=\"https://projectwomanohio.org/news-events/\" target=\"_blank\">Newsroom</a>\n\n            \n        </li>\n\n\n\n        <li class=\"nav-level-0\">\n            <a href=\"https://projectwomanohio.org/news-events/events.html\" target=\"_blank\">Events</a>\n\n            \n        </li>\n\n\n\n        <li class=\"nav-level-0\">\n            <a href=\"https://projectwomanohio.org/news-events/mailing-list.html\" target=\"_blank\">Join Our Mailing List</a>\n\n            \n        </li>\n\n\n\n        <li class=\"nav-level-0\">\n            <a href=\"https://projectwomanohio.org/news-events/links.html\" target=\"_blank\">Important Links</a>\n\n            \n        </li>\n\n\n\n        <li class=\"nav-level-0\">\n            <a href=\"https://projectwomanohio.org/news-events/diva-night-in.html\" target=\"_blank\">DIVA!
