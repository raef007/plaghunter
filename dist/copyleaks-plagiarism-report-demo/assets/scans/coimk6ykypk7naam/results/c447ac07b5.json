This movie follows five high school students who all have school detention on a Saturday morning. They all come. The Breakfast Club was directed by John Hughes and released in The film is about five students that have to spend a day together in Sa.\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\tAs insightful as he was prolific, Hughes got adolescence correct down to the last detail. The little things in The Breakfast Club register as much as the revelatory, tear-streaked monologues: the conspiratorial eye rolls shared by the alpha kids Claire and Andrew, the unselfconsciously displayed oral fixations of Allison and Brian she with her compulsive nail-biting, he with his pen-chewing.\n\nThat Hughes himself was in his midthirties in this period, and had been a happily married man since the tender age of twenty, makes The Breakfast Club all the more remarkable. Though relatively late to big-time Hollywood success, he rode the same wave as his peers, experiencing life as part of the first youth market specifically targeted by advertisers, buying new Beatles albums as they came out, upending the old Bob Hope—Rat Pack—Doris Day order seemingly overnight—essentially taking up all the space in the culture. They were forgotten. The Breakfast Club was, therefore, a mission as much as a movie.\nThis script, titled Sixteen Candles, so impressed Ned Tanen, a former studio head turned independent producer, that he gave Hughes a deal to direct both pictures, provided that he make Sixteen Candles first. It also afforded Hughes the chance to purge himself of some puerile, Lampoon -ish inclinations, such as a gratuitous topless-girl-in-shower scene and a crudely stereotypical Asian exchange-student character named Long Duk Dong.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tContribute to This Page.\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDescription:.\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tHomework for me.\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\tBy the time the Breakfast Club cast assembled in the spring of , Hughes was fully confident in his vision of a minutely observed chamber piece about teen angst that, while sprinkled with humor, was not a comedy.

In October , with the aid of the French who allied themselves with the colonists over their rivals the British , the Continental forces were able to capture British troops under General Charles Cornwallis in Yorktown, Virginia. This action effectively ended the Revolutionary War and Washington was declared a national hero. In , with a peace treaty signed between Great Britain and the U. However, in , he was asked to attend the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia and head the committee to draft the new constitution. At first Washington balked. He wanted to, at last, return to a quiet life at home and leave governing the new nation to others.\n\nBut public opinion was so strong that eventually he gave in. The first presidential election was held on January 7, , and Washington won handily. Because Washington, D. The United States was a small nation when Washington took office, consisting of 11 states and approximately 4 million people, and there was no precedent for how the new president should conduct domestic or foreign business. Mindful that his actions would likely determine how future presidents were expected to govern, Washington worked hard to set an example of fairness, prudence and integrity.\n\nIn foreign matters, he supported cordial relations with other countries but also favored a position of neutrality in foreign conflicts. Domestically, he nominated the first chief justice of the U. Supreme Court , John Jay , signed a bill establishing the first national bank and set up his own presidential cabinet.\n\nHis two most prominent cabinet appointees were Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson and Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton , two men who disagreed strongly on the role of the federal government. Washington believed that divergent views were critical for the health of the new government, but he was distressed at what he saw as an emerging partisanship. In , after two terms as president and declining to serve a third term, Washington finally retired.\n\nIn his farewell address, he urged the new nation to maintain the highest standards domestically and to keep involvement with foreign powers to a minimum.\nReset PasswordThe address is still read each February in the U. Washington returned to Mount Vernon and devoted his attentions to making the plantation as productive as it had been before he became president. Determined to keep \"our people in peace, \" Washington issued a neutrality proclamation, although the word \"neutrality\" was not used.\n\nHis purpose, Washington told Patrick Henry, was \"to keep the United States free from political connections with every other country, to see them independent of all and under the influence of none. In a word, I want an American character, that the powers of Europe may be convinced we act for ourselves and not for others.\n\nCitizen Genet, undeterred by the proclamation of neutrality, outfitted French privateers in American ports and organized expeditions against Florida and Louisiana. For his undiplomatic conduct, the Washington administration requested and obtained his recall. In the midst of the Genet affair, Great Britain initiated a blockade of France and began seizing neutral ships trading with the French West Indies.\n\nBesides violating American neutral rights, the British still held posts in the American Northwest, and the Americans claimed that they intrigued with the Indians against the United States. Frontier provocations, ship seizures, and impressment made war seem almost inevitable in , but Washington sent Chief Justice John Jay to negotiate a settlement of the differences between the two nations. Although Jay's Treaty was vastly unpopular—the British agreed to evacuate the Northwest posts but made no concessions on neutral rights or impressment—Washington finally accepted it as the best treaty possible at that time.\n\nThe treaty also paved the way for Thomas Pinckney's negotiations with Spanish ministers, now fearful of an Anglo-American entente against Spain in the Western Hemisphere. Washington happily signed Pinckney's Treaty, which resolved disputes over navigation of the Mississippi, the Florida boundary, and neutral rights.\n\nWhile attempting to maintain peace with Great Britain in , the Washington administration had to meet the threat of domestic violence in western Pennsylvania. The Whiskey Rebellion, a reaction against the first Federal excise tax, presented a direct challenge to the power of the Federal government to enforce its laws. After a Federal judge certified that ordinary judicial processes could not deal with the opposition to the laws, Washington called out 12, state militiamen \"to support our government and laws\" by crushing the rebellion.\n\nThe resistance quickly melted, and Washington showed that force could be tempered with clemency by pardoning the insurgents. Nearly all observers agree that Washington's 8 years as president demonstrated that executive power was completely consistent with the genius of republican government. Putting his prestige on the line in an untried office under an untried constitution, Washington was fully aware, as he pointed out in his First Inaugural Address, that \"the preservation of the sacred fire of liberty and the destiny of the republican model of government are justly considered, perhaps, as deeply, as finally, staked on the experiment entrusted to the hands of the American people.\nGeorge Washington FactsPerhaps Washington's chief strength—the key to his success as a military and a political leader—was his realization that in a republic the executive, like all other elected representatives, would have to measure his public acts against the temper of public opinion. As military commander dealing with the Continental Congress and the state governments during the Revolution, Washington had realized the importance of administrative skills as a means of building public support of the army. As president, he applied the same skills to win support for the new Federal government.\n\n\t\t\n\t\tGeorge Washington\n\t\t\n\t\t\tToward the end, he notes short essay on george washington \"free Negroes who have served in the Army, are very much dissatisfied at being discarded. Lord Stirling holds out the longest before surrendering the same day.

He worked hard, saved the money that he was earning, and then bought some land that had yet to be settled in the Virginian frontier. A Virginia Continental regiment on its way to aid Charleston gets as far as the Santee River before learning of the surrender and then turns back to North Carolina. In an effort to establish himself as a member of the gentry class, he worked hard, saved his money, and bought unclaimed land. A fairly gruesome war it. Washington was eager to prove he was good enough and that perspective is what leads to what he means to us today. He kept that little flicker of short essay on george washington that was still left, alive. On March 20,New York authorizes the enlistment of slaves in militia units, for which they receive their freedom at the end of the war.\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\tDespite Washington's abhorrence of factionalism, his administrations and policies spurred the beginnings of the first party system. This ultimately identified Washington, the least partisan of presidents, with the Federalist party, especially after Jefferson's retirement from the Cabinet in  Washington's Farewell Address, though it was essentially a last will and political testament to the American people, inevitably took on political coloration in an election year.\n\n\t\t\n\tWarning against the divisiveness of excessive party spirit, which tended to separate Americans politically as \"geographical distinctions\" did sectionally, he stressed the necessity for an American character free of foreign attachments. Two-thirds of his address dealt with domestic politics and the baleful influence of party; the rest of the document laid down a statement of firs principles of American foreign policy. But even here, Washington's warning against foreign entanglements was especially applicable to foreign interference in the domestic affairs of the United States.\n\nAmerican Revolutionary War. George Washington February 22, [3] [4] [5] — December 14, was the first President of the United States — , the commander in chief of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War , [6] and one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. Washington's mother was Mary Ball and his father was Augustine Washington. They owned a plantation with slaves in Virginia.\n\nGeorge studied at local schools in Fredericksburg, and was also homeschooled for part of his life.\nGeorge's mother was unfit to care for him and his father died when he was 11 years old. Washington became a farmer like his father. His plantation was called Mount Vernon. He also worked as a surveyor , measuring land. Washington always aspired to be a soldier and was active in the colonial militia of Virginia. He was sent several times to the \"forks of the Ohio River \" now called Pittsburgh. His job was to get rid of the French who were trying to take control of the Ohio River Valley. He failed and many of his men were killed. In , Washington married a widow named Martha Custis.\n\nThe marriage produced no children. Washington was a delegate to the First Continental Congress , which was created by the Thirteen Colonies to respond to various laws passed by the British government. Washington led the army from until the end of the war in  The British had more troops and more supplies than Washington, however, Washington kept his troops together and won these small battles. Overall, Washington did not win many battles, but he never let the British destroy his army.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tGeorge Washington Biography.\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tGeorge Washington Facts.\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tChildhood and Education.\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tEarly Political Career.\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tplan birthday party essay.\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\tWith the help of the French army and navy , Washington made a British army surrender at Yorktown, Virginia , in , as the final major battle of the Revolutionary War.

This movie follows five high school students who all have school detention on a Saturday morning. They all come. The Breakfast Club was directed by John Hughes and released in The film is about five students that have to spend a day together in Sa.</p>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\t<p>As insightful as he was prolific, Hughes got adolescence correct down to the last detail. The little things in The Breakfast Club register as much as the revelatory, tear-streaked monologues: the conspiratorial eye rolls shared by the alpha kids Claire and Andrew, the unselfconsciously displayed oral fixations of Allison and Brian she with her compulsive nail-biting, he with his pen-chewing.</p>\n\n<p>That Hughes himself was in his midthirties in this period, and had been a happily married man since the tender age of twenty, makes The Breakfast Club all the more remarkable. Though relatively late to big-time Hollywood success, he rode the same wave as his peers, experiencing life as part of the first youth market specifically targeted by advertisers, buying new Beatles albums as they came out, upending the old Bob Hope—Rat Pack—Doris Day order seemingly overnight—essentially taking up all the space in the culture. They were forgotten. The Breakfast Club was, therefore, a mission as much as a movie.</p>\n<p>This script, titled Sixteen Candles, so impressed Ned Tanen, a former studio head turned independent producer, that he gave Hughes a deal to direct both pictures, provided that he make Sixteen Candles first. It also afforded Hughes the chance to purge himself of some puerile, Lampoon -ish inclinations, such as a gratuitous topless-girl-in-shower scene and a crudely stereotypical Asian exchange-student character named Long Duk Dong.</p>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\"><div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<li>Contribute to This Page.</li>\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<li>Description:.</li>\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<li>Homework for me.</li>\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\n\t<p>By the time the Breakfast Club cast assembled in the spring of , Hughes was fully confident in his vision of a minutely observed chamber piece about teen angst that, while sprinkled with humor, was not a comedy. And in his determined quest for verisimilitude, he shot the film on location in the suburbs of Chicago, where he had himself spent his teen years.</p>\n\n<p>All rights reserved.

In October , with the aid of the French who allied themselves with the colonists over their rivals the British , the Continental forces were able to capture British troops under General Charles Cornwallis in Yorktown, Virginia. This action effectively ended the Revolutionary War and Washington was declared a national hero. In , with a peace treaty signed between Great Britain and the U. However, in , he was asked to attend the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia and head the committee to draft the new constitution. At first Washington balked. He wanted to, at last, return to a quiet life at home and leave governing the new nation to others.</p>\n\n<p>But public opinion was so strong that eventually he gave in. The first presidential election was held on January 7, , and Washington won handily. Because Washington, D. The United States was a small nation when Washington took office, consisting of 11 states and approximately 4 million people, and there was no precedent for how the new president should conduct domestic or foreign business. Mindful that his actions would likely determine how future presidents were expected to govern, Washington worked hard to set an example of fairness, prudence and integrity.</p>\n\n<p>In foreign matters, he supported cordial relations with other countries but also favored a position of neutrality in foreign conflicts. Domestically, he nominated the first chief justice of the U. Supreme Court , John Jay , signed a bill establishing the first national bank and set up his own presidential cabinet.</p>\n\n<p>His two most prominent cabinet appointees were Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson and Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton , two men who disagreed strongly on the role of the federal government. Washington believed that divergent views were critical for the health of the new government, but he was distressed at what he saw as an emerging partisanship. In , after two terms as president and declining to serve a third term, Washington finally retired.</p>\n\n<p>In his farewell address, he urged the new nation to maintain the highest standards domestically and to keep involvement with foreign powers to a minimum.</p>\n<a id=\"o1\"></a><h3>Reset Password</h3><p>The address is still read each February in the U. Washington returned to Mount Vernon and devoted his attentions to making the plantation as productive as it had been before he became president. Determined to keep \"our people in peace, \" Washington issued a neutrality proclamation, although the word \"neutrality\" was not used.</p>\n\n<p>His purpose, Washington told Patrick Henry, was \"to keep the United States free from political connections with every other country, to see them independent of all and under the influence of none. In a word, I want an American character, that the powers of Europe may be convinced we act for ourselves and not for others.</p>\n\n<p>Citizen Genet, undeterred by the proclamation of neutrality, outfitted French privateers in American ports and organized expeditions against Florida and Louisiana. For his undiplomatic conduct, the Washington administration requested and obtained his recall. In the midst of the Genet affair, Great Britain initiated a blockade of France and began seizing neutral ships trading with the French West Indies.</p>\n\n<p>Besides violating American neutral rights, the British still held posts in the American Northwest, and the Americans claimed that they intrigued with the Indians against the United States. Frontier provocations, ship seizures, and impressment made war seem almost inevitable in , but Washington sent Chief Justice John Jay to negotiate a settlement of the differences between the two nations. Although Jay's Treaty was vastly unpopular—the British agreed to evacuate the Northwest posts but made no concessions on neutral rights or impressment—Washington finally accepted it as the best treaty possible at that time.</p>\n\n<p>The treaty also paved the way for Thomas Pinckney's negotiations with Spanish ministers, now fearful of an Anglo-American entente against Spain in the Western Hemisphere. Washington happily signed Pinckney's Treaty, which resolved disputes over navigation of the Mississippi, the Florida boundary, and neutral rights.</p>\n\n<p>While attempting to maintain peace with Great Britain in , the Washington administration had to meet the threat of domestic violence in western Pennsylvania. The Whiskey Rebellion, a reaction against the first Federal excise tax, presented a direct challenge to the power of the Federal government to enforce its laws. After a Federal judge certified that ordinary judicial processes could not deal with the opposition to the laws, Washington called out 12, state militiamen \"to support our government and laws\" by crushing the rebellion.</p>\n\n<p>The resistance quickly melted, and Washington showed that force could be tempered with clemency by pardoning the insurgents. Nearly all observers agree that Washington's 8 years as president demonstrated that executive power was completely consistent with the genius of republican government. Putting his prestige on the line in an untried office under an untried constitution, Washington was fully aware, as he pointed out in his First Inaugural Address, that \"the preservation of the sacred fire of liberty and the destiny of the republican model of government are justly considered, perhaps, as deeply, as finally, staked on the experiment entrusted to the hands of the American people.</p>\n<a id=\"o2\"></a><h2>George Washington Facts</h2><p>Perhaps Washington's chief strength—the key to his success as a military and a political leader—was his realization that in a republic the executive, like all other elected representatives, would have to measure his public acts against the temper of public opinion. As military commander dealing with the Continental Congress and the state governments during the Revolution, Washington had realized the importance of administrative skills as a means of building public support of the army. As president, he applied the same skills to win support for the new Federal government.</p>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t<legend><a id=\"o3\"></a><h3>George Washington</h3></legend>\n\t\t<div class=\"jumbotron\">\n\t\t\t<p>Toward the end, he notes <strong>short essay on george washington</strong> \"free Negroes who have served in the Army, are very much dissatisfied at being discarded.

He worked hard, saved the money that he was earning, and then bought some land that had yet to be settled in the Virginian frontier. A Virginia Continental regiment on its way to aid Charleston gets as far as the Santee River before learning of the surrender and then turns back to North Carolina. In an effort to establish himself as a member of the gentry class, he worked hard, saved his money, and bought unclaimed land. A fairly gruesome war it. Washington was eager to prove he was good enough and that perspective is what leads to what he means to us today. He kept that little flicker of <i>short essay on george washington</i> that was still left, alive. On March 20,New York authorizes the enlistment of slaves in militia units, for which they receive their freedom at the end of the war.</p>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\t<p>Despite Washington's abhorrence of factionalism, his administrations and policies spurred the beginnings of the first party system. This ultimately identified Washington, the least partisan of presidents, with the Federalist party, especially after Jefferson's retirement from the Cabinet in  Washington's Farewell Address, though it was essentially a last will and political testament to the American people, inevitably took on political coloration in an election year.</p>\n\n\t\t\n\t<p>Warning against the divisiveness of excessive party spirit, which tended to separate Americans politically as \"geographical distinctions\" did sectionally, he stressed the necessity for an American character free of foreign attachments. Two-thirds of his address dealt with domestic politics and the baleful influence of party; the rest of the document laid down a statement of firs principles of American foreign policy. But even here, Washington's warning against foreign entanglements was especially applicable to foreign interference in the domestic affairs of the United States.</p>\n\n<p>American Revolutionary War. George Washington February 22, [3] [4] [5] — December 14, was the first President of the United States — , the commander in chief of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War , [6] and one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. Washington's mother was Mary Ball and his father was Augustine Washington. They owned a plantation with slaves in Virginia.</p>\n\n<p>George studied at local schools in Fredericksburg, and was also homeschooled for part of his life.</p>\n<p>George's mother was unfit to care for him and his father died when he was 11 years old. Washington became a farmer like his father. His plantation was called Mount Vernon. He also worked as a surveyor , measuring land. Washington always aspired to be a soldier and was active in the colonial militia of Virginia. He was sent several times to the \"forks of the Ohio River \" now called Pittsburgh. His job was to get rid of the French who were trying to take control of the Ohio River Valley. He failed and many of his men were killed. In , Washington married a widow named Martha Custis.</p>\n\n<p>The marriage produced no children. Washington was a delegate to the First Continental Congress , which was created by the Thirteen Colonies to respond to various laws passed by the British government. Washington led the army from until the end of the war in  The British had more troops and more supplies than Washington, however, Washington kept his troops together and won these small battles.
